When you plan to work on a contribution for a major change, it is best to begin with having a plan and ensuring that it conforms to the Clarity team's expectations for contributions. This can help everyone save time by ensuring we agree upon the implementation details prior to doing a lot of coding that might require major changes.

Copy the following content into a new ticket and fill out the details as much as possible. The more complete your details the better, but not all questions will apply for every change.

----------
```
# Summary

_Describe the change or feature in detail. Try to answer the following questions._ 

* What is the change?
* What is a use case for this change?
* Does this change impact existing behaviors? If so how?
* 

# Implementation Plan

_Describe how you plan to implement the feature, answering the following questions._

* What parts of the code are affected?
* Can you describe the basic code flow of the changes?
* Does this introduce asynchronous behaviors?
* What changes happen to existing code vs new code?

# API Changes

_Describe the API changes that are required for this change. Note clearly if anything *might* be a breaking change. API changes are things like adding or changing input/outputs, components, directives, services, or anything that is exported publicly. Any changes should also be demonstrated with code snippets that show the intended API._

# Examples

_If possible, show examples of the change. You may create one yourself, or link to external sites that have the idea. It can also be very useful to prototype the idea in isolation outside of Clarity with a Plunkr or Stackblitz example._

# Conclusion

_Describe how long you expect it to take to implement, what help you might need, and any other details that might be helpful._
