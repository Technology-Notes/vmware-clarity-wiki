When you plan to work on a contribution for a major change, it is best to begin with having a plan and ensuring that it conforms to the Clarity team's expectations for contributions. This can help everyone save time by ensuring we agree upon the implementation details prior to doing a lot of coding that might require major changes.

Copy the following content into a new ticket and fill out the details as much as possible. The more complete your details the better, but not all questions will apply for every change.

----------
```
# Summary

_Describe the change or feature in detail. Try to answer the following questions._ 

* What is the change?
* What is a use case for this change?
* Does this change impact existing behaviors? If so how?
* 

# API

_Describe the intended API for the feature you want to add: input/outputs, components, directives, services, or anything that is exported publicly. One of the best way to describe it is to show code snippets using this new feature. In the case of bug fixes or internal changes, there will most likely be no API changes. Please note clearly if anything *might* be a breaking change._

# Implementation Plan

_Describe how you plan to implement the feature, answering the following questions._

* What parts of the code are affected?
* Can you describe the basic code flow of the changes?
* Does this introduce asynchronous behaviors?
* What changes happen to existing code vs new code?

# Examples

_If possible, show examples of the change. You may create one yourself, or link to external sites that have the idea. It can also be very useful to prototype the idea in isolation outside of Clarity with a Plunkr or Stackblitz example._

# Conclusion

_Describe how long you expect it to take to implement, what help you might need, and any other details that might be helpful._
