Every one of the decisions we make on a daily basis has research and logical reasoning behind it.
Given the amount of detail and the sheer number of decisions that go in a single design,
we cannot jam every explanation in our documentation.

If you are curious about one of our decisions and would like to understand it better, feel free
to browse the various links in the sidebar under "Clarity Decisions" to find the one you are looking for. If you find that we didn't document something that you were looking for, please contact us and we will work to get it documented.
