Datagrid is one of our most complex components, and as such is the one for which we get the most questions
as to why we designed it this or that way. Here is a non-exhaustive list of the questions we receive on a daily basis.

* [Why does my Datagrid have extra whitespace when I have no/a single row?](Datagrid-minimum-height)
* [Why don't you support hierachical datagrids?](Hierarchical-datagrid)
* [When will you implement virtual scrolling?](Datagrid-virtual-scrolling)
* [What's your recommendation for an export functionality?](Datagrid-export)
