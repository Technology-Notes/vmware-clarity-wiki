Real documentation coming soon.

We recommend Adding an "Export" button in the action bar above the datagrid.
The pros of this solution are that it:
* enforces consistency (user knows to look in the button bar)
* allows for dropdown support for multiple types of download (CSV, PDF, HTML, etc)
* ties into the idea of performing actions against the datagrid
* i18n is handled by the app, using their solution


Here is a quick prototype of such a functionality: https://stackblitz.com/edit/clarity-datagrid-export
