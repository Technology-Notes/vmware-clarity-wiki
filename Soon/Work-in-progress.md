## Notes About Works In Progress

All ETAs are subject to change. We try our best to allot for changing priorities or discovery but estimation is an [inexact science when it comes to software](https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/30/estimate-thrice-develop-once/). When possible, we skew our estimates towards the liberal side of things. This is on purpose.

If your project requires a feature or component from our library to release, we are doing a disservice by being overly optimistic on our timelines. Which brings us to our next item:

If our ETA doesn't give you at least several weeks to integrate our changes into your app, _go to Plan B_. If our date slips because we were pulled onto another priority or because a new feature requires more refactoring than we had anticipated, you need to plan ahead as if that feature will _not_ be ready in time. In general, our estimations are good. In general, we deliver on or before our estimates. But at the end of the day, delivering quality components takes as long as it will take. And even if we deliver some new feature under the wire and just in time, your project will need time to upgrade to the new release and validate against any breaking changes or deprecations.

That said, if you find yourself at issue with our priorities or want to see if you can lend a helping hand in the interest of moving something along, please email me at [smathis@vmware.com](mailto:smathis@vmware.coml). We are open source and welcome contributions from the community. Oftentimes, the difference between "getting what you want" and "getting what you want when you need it" is being a proactive member of the community.

Thanks for building with Clarity!
