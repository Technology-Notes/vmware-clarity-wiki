# General
This page serves as a knowledge base for brain dumping our contribution guidelines. In order to encourage and standardize external contributions we need to establish a set of convetions that make it clear how external contributors should structure their code. From naming conventions to component architecture these are the ideas we will use to refine our external contributions. 

## Code

### SCSS & HTML
* Naming conventions - How do we name scss variables and component (child component) elements
* Template structure - What is our preferred approach to structuring style code and templates (I know we are using something bemish but I can't remember the name offhand)

### Typescript
* Naming conventions - Components, child components, variables and methods
* Component architecture
* API Patterns in use

### Filenames

### Build Tooling
* Script naming conventions in use

## Documentation & Website
### Demos
this is how we add / create / modify a component demo
### Page Layouts
these are common patterns in our component documentation pages
### Navigation
this describes the naviagtion / routing structure so its easy to know where to add something new
